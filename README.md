Power BI PwC Virtual Internship is an online, interactive program offered by PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers), one of the world’s leading professional services firms. The internship provides an opportunity for students and aspiring professionals to gain hands-on experience and develop practical skills in using Power BI, a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool. So I decided to delve into this program and get exposure to a reputable professional services firm like PwC, especially in the Data field. The program is divided into 4 tasks that I’m sharing here.
